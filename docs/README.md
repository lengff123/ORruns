# ORruns 
 **ORruns** is a lightweight experiment management tool tailored specifically for Operations Research, designed to simplify experiment tracking and visualization.  
 ## Key Features 
 - üîç **Experiment Tracking**: Track and organize your experiments with ease, ensuring every detail is recorded.
 - üìä **Web Dashboard**: Access a comprehensive dashboard for quick visualization and insights into your experiment results. 
 - üîÑ **Parallel Experiments**: Run multiple experiments in parallel to speed up the research process. 
 - ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Management**: Seamlessly manage and switch between different configurations for flexible experimentation.  ## Installation To install ORruns, simply use the following command: 
 ```bash # Installation command here (e.g., pip install orruns) ```

## Quick Start

Jump right in! Start tracking your experiments in just a few steps:

### Basic Usage

Set up and manage your experiments quickly with ORruns‚Äô easy-to-use interface.
```python
from orruns import ExperimentTracker

# Create tracker and log experiment
tracker = ExperimentTracker("optimization_experiment")

# Log parameters
tracker.log_params({
    "algorithm": "VNS",
    "max_iterations": 1000,
    "neighborhood_types": ["swap", "insert"]
})

# Log metrics
tracker.log_metrics({
    "objective_value": 42.0,
    "computation_time": 1.23
})
```
### Repeated Experiments

Efficiently handle and track repeated experiments with streamlined workflows.

```python
from orruns import repeat_experiment

@repeat_experiment(times=3, parallel=True)
def optimize_function(tracker):
    # Your optimization code here
    result = 42
    tracker.log_metrics({"objective": result})
    return result
```

### Configuration Management

Manage experiment configurations easily to test and iterate on different setups.

### Visualization

Gain quick insights with intuitive visualization tools, making it easier to analyze and interpret results.
